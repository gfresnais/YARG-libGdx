# YARG-libGdx
YARG a mobile game using libGdx

YARG or *Yet Another RPG* is a RPG mobile game developed in Java using the LibGdx Framework and Android Studio.

It's also a school project I made during my 4th year of engineering school in computer science at [ENSIM](http://ensim.univ-lemans.fr/fr/index.html)

## Downloads
Not available to download yet, it's still a WIP.
However the source code is available, see License below.
I plan to release it on F-Droid and itch.io if the game is in an advanced enough state, all of this for free of course.
